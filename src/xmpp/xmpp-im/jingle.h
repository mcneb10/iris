      * Active            - session was accepted and now active.
      * Finihed           - session-terminate was sent/received

      * Created           - after constructor till local user initiates the sending
      * ApprovedToSend    - user already clicked "send" but our offer is not ready yet (collecting candidates)

      * Accepted          - remote accepted the app. waiting for start() (for example when all session is accepted)
      * Connecting        - session was accepted (or content-accepted for early-session). negotiating connection
      * Active            - connection was established. now real data passes.
      * Finishing         - need to send some final statuses over signalling
      * Finished          - app was removed from session

     Local transport states (our initial offer or our outgoing transport-replace):
      * Created           - initial: just after constructor but before "send" button was pushed.
      *                     replace: if previous was > Created then replace will start right from ApprovedToSend
      * ApprovedToSend    - initial: we are preparing initial offer ("send" was pushed already)
      *                     replace: we are going to replace previously sent trasport offer. preparing new one
      * Unacked           - no iq "result" yet
      * Pending           - got iq result but no any kind of transport accept
      * Accepted          - session/content/transport-replace accepted. app should start negotiation explicitly
      * Connecting        - connetion negotiation
      * Active            - traferring data
      * Finished          - In failure case: Needs to report transport failure / replace / reject

     Remote transport states (remote initial offer or remote transport-replace):
      * Created           - short-term state before the initial offer has been parsed
      * Pending           - initial: local user hasn't accepted yet the offer
      *                     replace: remote changes its own offer before local accepted anything
      * ApprovedToSend    - initial/replace: user accepted the offer. we are preparing our response
      * Unacked           - no iq "result" yet
      * Accepted          - session/content/transport-replace accepted. app should start negotiation explicitly

     * The pads are connected to both session and transport/application manager
     * and their main task to handle Jingle session-info events.
     *
     * SessionManagerPad is a base class for all kinds of pads.
     * UI can connect to its signals.
